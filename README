sdl2 interface for Go

This library is very unfinished at the moment and not at all useful.

About:
Instead of just generating a wrapper library that wraps most of the SDL functions,
this library will go a step further and build an interface to SDL that is idiomatic
Go and fully documented. Use github.com/go-gl/gl for the gl library, as that's what
this library is tested with.

Contributing:
Use goimports before submitting any new code. Use golint to check for issues, but
use your judgement on any issues it brings up. New functionality should be accompanied
by new documentation, new Example* functions and new examples programs or adding new
functionality to an existing example program.

Get goimports from code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports

Get golint from github.com/golang/lint

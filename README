sdl2 interface for Go

This library is very unfinished at the moment and starting to be
more useful.

Note that I am not a developer on the SDL2 library, I'm just
writing a wrapper around the C interface they provide so I and
anyone using this go package can use their library.

About:
Instead of just generating a wrapper library that wraps most of the SDL functions,
this library will go a step further and build an interface to SDL that is idiomatic
Go and fully documented. Use github.com/go-gl/gl for the gl library, as that's what
this library will be tested to work with.

For example, in accordance with Effective Go (http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#Getters), 
getting attributes from SDL2 like Window Titles is done using the Title() function.
Setting a title involves the SetTitle function. Also all constants have their own type, and
are written in mixed caps. Channels will be provided for receiving events, and easily
confused multiple returns will have named returns. When reasonable, code will return
go stdlib stucts instead of creating similar structs in the sdl2 package. For instance,
color functions will return a color.RGBA struct instead of a sdl2.RGBA struct. Surface
creation functions can take an image.RGBA instead of a [] byte for the pixels.

Contributing:
Use goimports (instead of go fmt) before submitting any new code. Use golint to check
for issues, but use your judgement on any issues it brings up. New functionality
should be accompanied by new documentation, new Example* functions and new examples
programs or adding new functionality to an existing example program.

Get goimports from code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports

Get golint from github.com/golang/lint

difference between the licenses is that the BSD requires the copyright text be
included with binary versions while the zlib does not have the same requirement.
